# UnrealEngine-No-SSE-AVX 🚀

Run the **latest Unreal Engine Editor** on **older hardware** — no SSE4.2 or AVX required, and optimized for systems with **only 1GB VRAM**.

This project is a private fork of Unreal Engine that I maintain, designed to keep game development accessible for everyone, even on legacy machines.

## 💡 Why This Matters
Unreal Engine is powerful, but its hardware requirements leave many developers behind.  
This fork makes modern game development possible on **legacy platforms**, opening doors for:
- Indie developers with limited resources
- Students learning game dev on older PCs
- Hobbyists experimenting without expensive upgrades
